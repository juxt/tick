= tick

A Clojure(Script) & babashka library for dealing with time. Intended as a
replacement for clj-time.

Based on Java 8 time (on the JVM) and js-joda (on JavaScript
runtimes). Javascript's modern date-time API https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal[Temporal] is a consideration as an alternative foundation for tick in future. See the 
https://github.com/henryw374/tempo[Tempo] library if interested. 

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFuL-ZDoB2U[Henry Widd's talk at Clojure/North 2019] for some background

== Status

* tick.core - stable
* tick.alpha.interval - Alpha: Ready to use with the caveat that the API might still undergo minor changes. Note also that this part of tick is not being actively maintained at the moment (other than to keep existing tests passing). There are currently around https://github.com/juxt/tick/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ainterval-calculus[4 open tickets]  relating to intervals which no one is looking at. It may be maintained again in the future of course.

== Should you use Tick for date-time work?

* If you are just working on the JVM and are comfortable with the `java.time` API then raw interop will work just fine.
* If you are working in a Javascript environment then seriously consider using https://github.com/henryw374/cljc.java-time[cljc.java-time]: Its build size https://widdindustries.com/blog/clojurescript-datetime-lib-comparison.html[will not adversely affect your users] (unless in a highly constrained context such as a https://github.com/mfikes/esprit[microcontroller]). The reason is the native Date API is https://maggiepint.com/2017/04/09/fixing-javascript-date-getting-started/[flawed]
* If you meet any of the following criteria, use https://github.com/henryw374/cljc.java-time[cljc.java-time]:
** are creating cross-platform date-time logic
** are not proficient in java.time and would like https://widdindustries.com/why-not-interop/[improved error messages]
** would rather not maintain type hints in your code
* If you meet the criteria to use cljc.java-time but would like a more terse API and the benefits of e.g. https://juxt.github.io/tick/#_substitution[(t/with-clock ...)] but will not miss having every date-time recipe one google search away, then tick might be a good choice. Tick uses https://github.com/henryw374/cljc.java-time[cljc.java-time] so you can always drop to that if Tick is missing something you need.
* Similar in aiming for a terse API, but jvm-only is https://github.com/dm3/clojure.java-time[clojure.java-time].

== Usage 

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[tick.core :as t])

;; Get the current time
(t/instant)
----

=== Top tips 

==== java.time

In both Clojure and Clojurescript versions, tick is just calling through to java.time methods. Understanding https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/overview.html[the main entities of java.time] is necessary to use tick. For example, one should know that there are 2 separate ways to measure amounts of time (Period and Duration), 3 ways to represent a point on the timeline (Instant, ZonedDateTime & OffsetDateTime) and so on.

==== Instants 

Instants are not 'calendar-aware' - they just contain millis+nanos fields representing an 
offset from the Unix epoch. This means Instants have no method to get their year or month for example, 
because to do so would require a calendar (e.g. the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar[Gregorian calendar]).

However, the following does work in Tick:
`(t/year (t/instant))`. To make that possible, tick first converts the Instant into a ZonedDateTime 
(which does have a calendar). Take note however that the zone of the ZonedDateTime will be the 
browser's or jvm's timezone. To be explicit about the zone required do this:  

[source,clojure]
----
(-> (t/instant)
    (t/in "UTC")
    (t/year))
----

The other cases where calendar-awareness might come up is when formatting Instants to string or when
shifting them by e.g. years/months, so Tick 
https://widdindustries.com/why-not-interop/[shows explanatory error messages in that case].

=== Singular vs Plural ?

As with java.time, any functions working with amounts of time (ie Durations or Periods), 
will have names which are in the plural. Functions that
work with dates and times are singular. Knowing that, e.g. `t/second` vs `t/seconds` 
makes sense.

== Install

Get the latest from https://clojars.org/tick[Clojars] and
add to your `project.clj`, `build.boot` or `deps.edn`.

To use this from Clojurescript, you must have at least version 1.11.51. If using shadow-cljs, it must be at least version 2.19.3

If using cljsjs, add https://clojars.org/henryw374/js-joda[js-joda] and https://clojars.org/henryw374/js-joda-locale-en-us[js-joda-locale-en-us] and https://clojars.org/cljsjs/js-joda-timezone[js-joda-timezone] to your dependencies as well.

For Clojurescript users of Tick, see https://github.com/juxt/tick/blob/master/docs/cljs.adoc[docs/cljs.adoc], for
some discussion around Clojurescript build size.

Here is a one-liner to drop into a node repl with tick:

----
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "RELEASE" } tick/tick {:mvn/version "RELEASE"} henryw374/js-joda {:mvn/version "RELEASE"} }}' -m cljs.main  -re node  --repl
----

Here is how to get to a babashka (v 1.2.174+) repl with tick:

----
export BABASHKA_CLASSPATH=$(clojure -Spath -Sdeps '{:deps {tick/tick {:mvn/version "0.6.0"}}}')

== Development

=== Develop The Documentation Site

Build the html
----
make
----

`make dev-docs-cljs` to build the js for the site needs fixing.


=== Build a production version of the Documentation Site

The following is not working currently:

----
make release-docs-cljs
----

=== Develop Tick

----
clj -Atest-clj:test-cljs
----

 - To start testing clojurescript, follow instructions in the `cljs` ns.
 - To start testing clojure, follow instructions in the the `repl` ns.

See the .github dir to see instructions for CLI testing

=== Release

create a git tag.

`make install` (this installs in ~/.m2 - check that things look ok)

`make deploy`  - you need to have set up clojars credentials as per https://github.com/applied-science/deps-library

`git push origin new-tag-name`

== Acknowledgements

In particular, special credit to Eric Evans for discovering Allen's
interval algebra and pointing out its potential usefulness,
demonstrating a working implementation of Allen's ideas in
link:https://github.com/domainlanguage/time-count[his Clojure library].

Thanks also to my esteemed colleagues Patrik Kårlin for his redesign of
the interval constructor function, and Henry Widd for porting to cljc.
