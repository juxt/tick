= tick

A Clojure library for dealing with time.

== Install

Add to your lein or boot dependencies:

=== Dependencies

Tick is dependent on Clojure 1.9, since it uses +clojure.spec+.

== Timelines

Tick adds the concept of immutable *timelines* to java.time. A
timeline is a lazy but orderered sequence of maps, each containing a
`java.time.ZonedDateTime` entry (under the key `:tick/date`.

Timelines are easy to generate. One generator is `periodic-seq`, which
generates a uniform series of times separated by a fixed period.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[tick.core :refer [minutes]]
          [tick.timeline :refer [timeline periodic-seq]]
          [tick.clock :refer [now]])

;; A timeline of 15 minute intervals
(take 10
  (timeline (periodic-seq (now) (minutes 15))))
----

Timelines are sequences of ticks, and ticks are Clojure maps. Here's one:

[source,clojure]
----
{:tick/date #object[java.time.ZonedDateTime 0x5a56528d "2012-12-04T05:21Z[Europe/London]"]}
----

Timelines can be finite or, or of course, infinite so

[source,clojure]
----
(set! *print-length* 16)
----

to avoid eternal waits.

== Interleaving timelines

Multiple timelines can be interleaved into a consolidated timeline.

`interleave-timelines` takes any number of timelines and returns a
conslidated time-ordered timeline.  amalgamation.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[tick.cal])

(def holidays
  (interleave-timelines
    (timeline (tick.cal/bank-holiday-mondays))
    (timeline (tick.cal/easter-fridays))))
----

== Schedules

Clojure's `map` takes a function and applies it to every item in a
sequence. Similarly, tick's `schedule` takes a function and applies it
to timelines.

Schedules can be run by starting them with a clock.

[source,clojure]
----
(def schedule (tick.schedule/schedule println timeline))
;; note that the scheduled function   ^^^^^^^   takes one argument 

(tick.schedule/start schedule (tick.clock/clock-ticking-in-seconds))
----

You can `stop`, `pause` and `resume` schedules too.

== Testing

A type of schdule, useful for testing, can be created with `simulate`.

[source,clojure]
----
(def simulator (tick.schedule/simulate println timeline))

(tick.schedule/start simulator (tick.clock/fixed-clock ...))
----

If you want to wait for a ticker to complete its journey over a
timeline, `deref` the result of `start`.

At any time after starting a ticker you can find out its future
timeline with `remaining`, while inspecting its clock with `clock`.

== java.time

Most Clojure time libraries use clj-time, but tick uses
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-date-time-2125367.html[**java.time**]
which means that it requires Java 8.

Java 8's `java.time` API is both influenced by, and superior to, Joda
Time. It is a modern immutable API that supports functional
programming. Unless you're stuck on Java 7 or ambivalent about library
choice, you should be using `java.time`.

== Discussion

The 'flow of time' complicates our systems and we can simplify them if
we separate the concept of a timeline from the 'flow' of time we
perceive.

For more information, see the author's talk at ClojuTRE-2016 on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odPAkEO2uPQ[The
Universe As A Value] where he argues that time is a perception.

== Acknowledgements

Tick is based on the same original idea as
https://github.com/jarohen/chime[Chime]. The motivation is to be
able to view timelines of remaining times while the schedule is
running. Thanks to James Henderson for his work on Chime.
