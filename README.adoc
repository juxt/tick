= tick

A Clojure(Script) library for dealing with time. Intended as a
replacement for clj-time.

Based on Java 8 time (on the JVM) and js-joda (on JavaScript
runtimes).

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[tick.alpha.api :as t])

;; Get the current time
(t/now)
----

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFuL-ZDoB2U[Henry Widd's talk at Clojure/North 2019] for some background

== Docs

http://juxt.pro/tick/docs/index.html[Tick Documentation]

== Status

Alpha: Ready to use with the caveat that the API might still undergo
minor changes.

== Install

Get the latest from https://clojars.org/tick[Clojars] and 
add to your `project.clj`, `build.boot` or `deps.edn`. 

Tick versions 0.4.24-alpha and up require minimum Clojurescript version of 1.10.741

There are some extra considerations when using tick from Clojurescript, see file `docs/cljs.adoc` in this repo. 

Here is a one-liner to drop into a node repl with tick:

----
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.741" } tick {:mvn/version "0.4.24-alpha"} }}' -m cljs.main  -re node  --repl
----

=== Develop The Documentation Site

Build the Cljs
----
make dev-docs-cljs
----

Build the html
----
make docs/index.html
----

Serve the docs directory and navigate to it in a browser

=== Develop Tick

REPL with nREPL server

----
make nrepl
----

connect to the printed port

Once in, start cljs build with:

----
(figwheel-start!)
----

Run tests with:

----
make test
----

== Acknowledgements

Tick is based on the same original idea as
https://github.com/jarohen/chime[Chime]. The motivation is to be
able to view timelines of remaining times while the schedule is
running. Thanks to James Henderson for his work on Chime.

In particular, special credit to Eric Evans for discovering Allen's
interval algebra and pointing out its potential usefulness,
demonstrating a working implementation of Allen's ideas in
link:https://github.com/domainlanguage/time-count[his Clojure library].

Thanks also to my esteemed colleagues Patrik Kårlin for his redesign of
the interval constructor function, and Henry Widd for porting to cljc.
