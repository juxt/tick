= Formatting 

If it is de/serialization of java.time objects that is needed, then the https://clojars.org/time-literals[time-literals]
library is the right tool for that.

Tick includes a small formatting api over that provided by jsr-310

In ClojureScript, require ns _[tick.locale-en-us]_ to create custom formatters

----
 (require '[tick.alpha.api :as t])    
 
 (t/format :iso-zoned-date-time (t/zoned-date-time))
 
 (require '[tick.locale-en-us]) ; only need this require for custom format patterns
 ; and it's only needed for cljs, although the ns is cljc
 (t/format (tick.format/formatter "yyyy-MMM-dd") (t/date))
