= Clocks

In tick, clocks are used for getting the current time, in a given
time-zone. You should prefer using clocks to making direct calls to
`(System/currentTimeMillis)`, because this then allows you and others
to plugin alternative clocks, perhaps for testing purposes.

====
You create a clock that tracks the current time.

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/clock)
----

With an argument, you can fix a clock to always report a fixed time.

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/clock "1999-12-31T23:59:59")
----
====

== Construction

[%header,cols="l,a,l"]
|===
|Code|Description|Return type
|(t/clock)|Return a clock that will always return the current time|java.time.Clock
|===

== Derivation

Just like times and dates, you can time-shift clocks forward and
backward using the `>>` and `<<` functions respectively.

====
Shift a clock to run 2 hours slow.

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/<< (t/clock) (t/new-duration 2 :hours))
----
====

[%header,cols="l,a,l"]
|===
|Code|Description|Return type
|(t/<< (t/clock) (t/new-duration 2 :minutes))|Return a clock running 2 minutes slow|java.time.Clock
|(t/>> (t/clock) (t/new-duration 2 :minutes))|Return a clock running 2 minutes fast|java.time.Clock
|===

== Comparison

NOTE: TBD

== Atomic clocks?

In Clojure, an atom is a holder of a value at a particular time. Similarly, a _tick_ atom is a clock holding the clock's time, which is constantly changing.

You create this atom with `(atom)`. Naturally, you can get the instant of the atom's clock by dereferencing, e.g. `@(atom)`

----
user> (def clk (t/atom))
user> (println @clk)
#object[java.time.Instant 0x2e014670 2018-02-28T07:52:52.302Z]
(some time later)
user> (println @clk)
#object[java.time.Instant 0x6e5b1dca 2018-02-28T08:01:50.622Z]
----

====
You can also create an atom with a clock.

[source.code,clojure]
----
(let [clk (t/atom (t/clock))]
  @clk)
----
====

[%header,cols="l,a,l"]
|===
|Code|Description|Return type
|(t/atom)|Return a clock that tracks the current time|java.time.Clock
|===


== Substitution

A clock can be used to callibrate tick to a particular time and time-zone, if system defaults are not desired.

As I'm currently writing this in London, on my system I get the following when I use '(zone)'.

----
(t/zone)

=> #object[java.time.ZoneRegion 0x744a6545 "Europe/London"]
----

However, if we wanted to test in New York, we can set the clock to exist in that time-zone:

----
(t/with-clock (-> (t/clock) (t/in "America/New_York"))
  (t/zone))

=> #object[java.time.ZoneRegion 0x5a9d412 "America/New_York"]
