= Intervals

In _tick_, an interval is a span of time defined by two points in time, the first being before the second.

Intervals are maps containing both a `tick/beginning` and a `tick/end` entry. This flexible design allows any Clojure map to be treated as an interval.

Intervals can be represented two local times as well as instants.

== Construction

Obviously, the Clojure's literal syntax for maps can be used to create intervals.

====
Here we use a literal map syntax to construct an interval representing the last 5 minutes of 2018 (in UTC).

[source.code,clojure]
----
{:tick/beginning "2018-12-31T23:55:00Z"
 :tick/end "2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
----

====

Alternatively, we can use the `t/new-interval` function which takes the two boundaries of the interval as its arguments.

====
[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/new-interval
  (t/instant "2018-12-31T23:55:00Z")
  (t/instant "2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"))
----

== Derivation

Dates, months and years can also be considered to be themselves ranges, and can be converted to intervals with the `t/bounds` function.

====
To return today as an interval:

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/bounds (t/today))
----
====

The arguments to `t/new-interval` do not have to be instants, they can be any time supported by _tick_.

====
To return a 2-day interval spanning midnight this morning to midnight [#eval-two-days-from-today]#two days from today#:
// Calculate the day today plus 2 days

[source.code,clojure]
----
(t/new-interval (t/today) (t/tomorrow))
----
====

== Comparison

Two intervals can be compared against each other with the `t/relation` function. link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_interval_algebra[Allen's interval algebra] tells us there are 13 possible relations between two intervals.

.Interval relations
====
Consider the time-span represented by the word 'yesterday' and compare it to the time-span represented by the word 'tomorrow'. Since yesterday is before tomorrow, with a gap between them, we say that yesterday _precedes_ tomorrow:

[source.code#relation-yesterday-tomorrow,clojure]
----
(t/relation (t/yesterday) (t/tomorrow))
----

If the two intervals touch each other, in the case of 'today' and 'tomorrow', then we say the first interval (today) _meets_ the second interval (tomorrow).

[source.code#relation-today-tomorrow,clojure]
----
(t/relation (t/today) (t/tomorrow))
----

To see other possible relations, use the slider in the diagram below to move the top interval along:

== Collections

It is often useful to group intervals into collections and have
functions operate on those collections.

For example, you may want to gather together:

* all the time intervals when you were working last week
* system outages over a given period
* public holidays and weekends this year

NOTE: Discuss ordered sequences of disjoint intervals.
