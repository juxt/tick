= Durations & periods

A *Duration* instance stores time as an amount of *seconds*, for example 5.999999999 seconds.   

A *Period* instance stores amounts of *years*, *months* and *days*, for example -1 years, 20 months and 100 days

The javadocs refer to these entities as *time-based*  and *date-based*, respectively. 

The reason for having both representations is that the Period units are variable length (leap years, DST etc) but the time-based ones are not. 

So for example a Duration of 48 hours will not the same span as a Period of 2 days in all contexts.

Note that https://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/[threeten-extra] has an additional PeriodDuration entity

== Construction

[%header,cols="l,a,l"]
|===
|Code|Description|Return type
|(t/new-duration 1 :seconds)|Duration of a second|java.time.Duration
|(t/new-duration 100 :days)|Duration of 100 days|java.time.Duration
|(t/new-period 100 :days)|Period of 100 days|java.time.Period
|(t/new-period 2 :months)|Period of 2 months|java.time.Period
|===

=== Days, Months, Yearsâ€¦

Instances of other `java.time` types are readily constructed with _tick_.

[%header,cols="l,a,l"]
|===
|Example|Description|Return type
|(day "mon")|Monday|java.time.DayOfWeek
|(month "August")|August|java.time.Month
|(month 12)|December|java.time.Month
|(year-month "2012-12")|December 2012|java.time.YearMonth
|(year 1999)|The year 1999|java.time.Year
|===

== Derivation

* Add durations to durations

== Comparison

NOTE: TBD

== Misc

NOTE: TODO Don't forget you can create zone-offsets from durations!

====
NOTE: TODO Don't forget you can create instants from durations - this is often needed when you get Unix times (e.g. JWT OAuth2 tokens)

The problem with numeric times is that there are cases where the units
are in seconds and cases where milliseconds are used. If _tick_ were
to convert numbers to times, it would be a source of confusion and
bugs if the units were not clear. For this reason, you cannot convert
numbers to times. However, you can first create the duration from the
number, specifying the units explicitly, and then convert the duration
to an `instant` (or `inst`).
